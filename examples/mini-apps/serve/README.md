# Telegram Mini App example

### [Read Telegram's Mini App docs](https://core.telegram.org/bots/webapps)

This repo only serves as a minimal example of what a Telegram Mini App could do. You could use this as a reference. This only uses vanilla JavaScript, and no frameworks. That exercise is left to you.

The `@types/telegram-web-app` package is installed in this repo to provide types for `window.Telegram.WebApp`.
